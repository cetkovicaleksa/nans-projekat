### Project for class "Numerićki algoritmi i numerički softver"



The main part of the project is in the [notebook](https://github.com/cetkovicaleksa/nans-projekat/blob/main/nans.ipynb) file, while there are other important scripts that
prepared the data and did extrapolation in [extrapolation.py](https://github.com/cetkovicaleksa/nans-projekat/blob/main/extrapolation.py) and [create_table.py](https://github.com/cetkovicaleksa/nans-projekat/blob/main/create-table.py). 
Also in [second_question.py](https://github.com/cetkovicaleksa/nans-projekat/blob/main/second_question.py) you can find some code that tries to find out which region and/or area has had the most tourists over the given years.
